/*
* NOTE: As convention, there's 5 questions in the assignment Q1(Forming SIR Model), Q2(Euler's' Method) , 
*Q3(Random sampling parameters), Q4(Calculate R upon sample and data), Q5(Machine Learning).
* And 5 members in our group: H.Long(L), Q.Anh(A), H.Hai(H), H.Dung(D), D.Thuan(T)
* I will be using the short hand notation of the questions(Q1,..) and people(A,..) in the Log.

Date		AproxTime	Duration	Work			Description
3-7-2020	7AM		1Day		Received Assignment	Got email for the assignment's PDF
									Form and initiate group to start reading material
									Created overleaf link for work.
									Setup metting time
									
4-7-2020	9PM		2Hours		Online Meeting		Meeting through google-meet to form ideas and Q-A initial questions
									Setup face-to-face metting time
									
5-7-2020	2PM		3Hours		Offline Meeting		Go through again the materials as a groups
									Discuss and try to get everyone on the same page for the assignment's questions
									Help all to understand the difficult excercises (Q3, Q4), still has to figure out Q4
									Decided to skip Q5 due to difficulty and time constrain, will go back if have more time.
									Set priority on focusing Q1, Q2 and Q3 for the next few days
									Work Assignment:Q1 - (L,T) , (A,D) - Q2 ,Q3 - (H, everyone), Q4 - read_more, Q5 skip.
									Setup next meeting time.
									
6-7-2020	x		x		Current Process		Introduction to SIR, SIR extensions, Decide to choose model for Q1 and Q2 as SEIRD
									Created github and drive folder for work
									Introduction to euler's method
									Research on Q3 and Q4
									
8-7-2020	x		x		Current Process		Constructed continous, discrete model for SEIRD Model
									Had working code for running Metropolis Hasting (log-scaled)
									Finished Euler's method, code and example for SIR model, researching on extensions
									Researching on Q4
									Gathering questions to maybe ask lecturer (all question gather was resolved later so none were sent to teacher)

									
10-7-2020	x		x		Current Process		Added introduction to Modified Euler and Runge-Kutta Method, code for both method
									Applied Euler's method to SIR for example
									Testing Q4
									
12-7-2020	x		x		Current Process		Added explanations for SIERD Model
									Added example for SIR and SIERD Model
									Start cross-checking each other's current report's work.
									Setup meeting time

13-7-2020	3PM		2Hours		Offline Meeting		Discuss the current report's status
									Discuss the current approach to Q3 and Q4
									Note some problems at hand (bad Q4 sample)
									Discuss the report's outline for Q3 and Q4
									
14-7-2020	x		x		Current Process		Finished Q1, Q2
									Got outline for Q3 and Q4
									Work Assignment: L(Markov Chain and related theory), A(Metropolis Hasting), H(Random Walk MPH on SIR), D(Ro of SIR), T(Monte-Carlo Integration)

16-7-2020	x		x		Current Process		Introduced Metropolis Hasting, history, general algorithm, steps
									Explained Ro's meaning in SIR and it's formula
									Explained probability space, stochastic process, Markov Chain
									Introduced Monte-Carlo Integrationa and the naive method
									Successfully sampled beta, gamma for SIR and calculated Ro (background progress)
									Added current refferences to the report
									Setup meeting time
									
18-7-2020	9PM		3Hours		Online Meeting		Read through report together and try and explain the mentioned theories
									Discuss about the Metropolis Hasting random walk algorithm for Multivariate variable.
									Setup follow up meeting
									
19-7-2020	2PM		4Hours		Offline Meeting		Go through remaining theories on the report
									Disscuss the report's status, what theory to keep and remove, structure comments, notation inconsitance, parts needed to be add and change,..
									Disscuss the approach to Q4, using Monte-Carlo Intergration (important sampling) on Ro. Sample for beta and gamma is drawn from Metro-Polis Hasting, which follows a posterior distribution we not know but is proportional to a likelihood and a prior distribution.
									Disscuss how to calculate the likelihood using assumptions and SIR model estimated by Runge-Kutta Method
									Disscuss how to apply the method to a country's data, the method must yield a meaningful result reflecting the country's measurements against the pandemic
									Aim: Calculate Ro for two time period: 1 week before and after a country's social distancing measure is enforced, to see how it affect the Ro.
									Work assignment: Make changes to the current report (Q3 mostly) as disscused in meeting and move on to reading more about Q4 to start writing report.
								
20-7-2020	x		x		Current Progress	Removed unnecessary theories
									Redo the Monte Carlo Integration 
									Change the writing of Metropolis Hasting
									Added example for Q3
								
22-7-2020	x		x		Current Progress	Added Bayes Inference for Ro
									Added implementation details for calculating Ro (log-scale, transition kernel, likelihood calculation)
									Added report's introduciton and motivation for Q4
									Work Assignment: D and T (Monte-Carlo Integration, apply on Ro), H and L and A (Sampling and calculating Ro for given data, conclusion)
