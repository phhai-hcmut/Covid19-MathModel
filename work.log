/*
* NOTE: As convention, there's 5 questions in the assignment Q1(Forming SIR Model), Q2(Euler's' Method) , 
*Q3(Random sampling parameters), Q4(Calculate R upon sample and data), Q5(Machine Learning).
* And 5 members in our group: H.Long(L), Q.Anh(A), H.Hai(H), H.Dung(D), D.Thuan(T)
* I will be using the short hand notation of the questions(Q1,..) and people(A,..) in the Log.

4-7-2020	9PM		2Hours		Online Meeting		Meeting through google-meet to form ideas and Q-A initial questions
									Setup face-to-face metting time
									
5-7-2020	2PM		3Hours		Offline Meeting		Go through again the materials as a groups
									Discuss and try to get everyone on the same page for the assignment's questions
									Help all to understand the difficult excercises (Q3, Q4), still has to figure out Q4
									Decided to skip Q5 due to difficulty and time constrain, will go back if have more time.
									Set priority on focusing Q1, Q2 and Q3 for the next few days
									Work Assignment:Q1 - (L,T) , (A,D) - Q2 ,Q3 - (H, everyone), Q4 - read_more, Q5 skip.
									Current goal for the next few days: Finish Q1, Q2 and figure out questions,... for Q3,Q4 to ask for teacher's guidence.
									Setup next meeting time.
									
6-7-2020	x		x		Current Process		Introduction to SIR, SIR extensions, Decide to choose model for Q1 and Q2 as SEIRD
									Created github and drive folder for work
									Introduction to euler's method
									Research on Q3 and Q4
									
8-7-2020	x		x		Current Process		Constructed continous, discrete model for SEIRD Model
									Had working code for running Metro-Polis Hasting (log-scaled)
									Finished Euler's method, code and example for SIR model, researching on extensions
									Researching on Q4
									Gathering questions to maybe ask lecturer (all question gather was resolved later)

									
10-7-2020	x		x		Current Process		Added introduction to Modified Euler and Runge-Kutta Method, code for both method
									Applied Euler's method to SIR for example
									Testing Q4
									
12-7-2020	x		x		Current Process	Added explanations for SIERD Model
									Added example for SIR and SIERD Model
									Start cross-checking each other's current report's work.
									Setup meeting time
